UIElements
- table (finish off; edit functionality, etc)
- rich text box (can't do anything with this yet - it behaves totally different to a standard text field
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...

Need to create my own wpf app to run tests against - using the one from the white project is limiting

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- simple instructions in readme
