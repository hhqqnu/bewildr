UIElements
- table (finish off; edit functionality, etc)
- rich text box (can't do anything with this yet - it behaves totally different to a standard text field
- make tree nodes clickable/double_clickable/right_clickable

Need to create my own wpf app to run tests against - using the one from the white project is limiting

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- simple instructions in readme
