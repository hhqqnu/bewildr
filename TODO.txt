UIElements
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...
- scroll hidden items into view before acting on them
- allow user-created additions for custom object types
- build drag and drop into elements
- make 'items' and 'list_items' methods return the same thing, add an 'items_names' method to return what 'items' does at the moment
- make ListAdditions.selected return the selected object, not its name

Execution Logic
- Continue implementation of clearer exceptions for things like editing a disabled text field
