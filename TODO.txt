UIElements
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...
- images
- scroll hidden items into view before acting on them
- methods to allow access to sibling elements
- allow user-created additions for custom object types
- add a scroll-hack-check when expanding tree nodes

Execution Logic
- Continue implementation of clearer exceptions for things like editing a disabled text field

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- github wiki pages
