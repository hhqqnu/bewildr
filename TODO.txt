UIElements
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...
- images
- increase the size of the list box to see if scrolling is necessary
- drag and drop
- visible?
- scroll hidden items into view before acting on them

App Management
- write tests and functionality for starting the app with command line args, working directories etc (start_with_settings method)

Execution Logic
- Continue implementation of clearer exceptions for things like editing a disabled text field
- fix build_element to work dynamically rather than by using a case statement

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- github wiki pages
- create a 'watir-like' grid explaining what methods are available on what object types
