UIElements
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...
- images
- drag and drop
- visible?
- scroll hidden items into view before acting on them

Input
- write wrapper class for BewildrClickr, replace current calls to dll

Execution Logic
- Continue implementation of clearer exceptions for things like editing a disabled text field
- fix build_element to work dynamically rather than by using a case statement

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- github wiki pages
