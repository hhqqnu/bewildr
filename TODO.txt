UIElements
- table (finish off; edit functionality, etc)
- find a way to multi-select items in a multi-select list box... can't seem to do this with boilerplate ms ui automation libraries...
- images
- remove logic that converts array with one element to the element itself
- increase the size of the list box to see if scrolling is necessary
- deal with NoClickablePointException

Execution Logic
- Better exception throwing, eg: check for enabled state of textfield before attempting to set the text
- specifically, check .exe file exists before trying to execute it; deal with missing exe appropriately

Documentation
- rdoc for everything
- github wiki pages
- create a 'watir-like' grid explaining what methods are available on what object types
